# DestinyCubemaps
Destiny 2 cubemap viewer and browser made in JavaScript.

The cubemaps are taken directly from Destiny 2, with some of the visual artifacting caused by BC7 to PNG conversion. The images are used in the game primarily for reflections, but can sometimes provide insight by providing in-dev or alternate-angle images. Also it's just cool.
